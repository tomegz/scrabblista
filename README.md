# Scrabblista
My first *big* personal project. It's a web app for finding words for Scrabble-like games. It's using open-source polish dictionary available at [sjp.pl][1] saved into a Trie data structure. This repository is a mess, if you're looking for depth-first search implementation, it's [here][3].
